 KiwiSDR Three knob Webtuner
This software was at first initiated by PA1KE 7 may 2021
badsed on an article in the Dutch Ham magazine "Electron"
April 2021 where an indication of use of one (optical) Rotary encoder 
for Web SDR control was suggested for a limited set of functions for 
several WebSDR's.

The first ALFA releaseof this softwaer was done on Github at 26 mai2021 
The idea of the Three Knob (Kiwi)SDRTuner is to access  
all the function that are made accessible in the original
KiwiSDR software. This is done by means of an XIAO (SAMND21), Arduino like)
processor board. Three ordinary cheap rotary encoders with a OLED dsplay 128x64 
are the only components used.
